            <p class="card-excerpt">Household chores and children’s care are every adult’s responsibility. Ask yourself
              if there is an equal division of labor in your home. The work of caring for children is still done mainly
              by women in much of the world. A report released by the UN in 2015 points out that women from developing
              countries do over three hours more of daily unpaid work (household chores and childcare) than men, while
              in developed countries, they do, on average, two hours more.According to studies, the overload of
              household chores can increase women’s chances of mental illnesses, besides depressing their productivity
              at work, consequently affecting their salaries.</p>

            <p class="card-excerpt">Get some help and support if you know a friend or acquaintance is suffering from
              domestic violence or other abuse. This type of violence is not restricted to physical aggression. Verbal
              attacks (curses and threats) and psychological abuse (controlling, manipulative and intimidating behavior)
              also affect women. Often, all these things occur together. If you experience domestic violence, be aware
              that you are not alone. Report it!
              The same UN report quoted above points out that in most countries with data available, less than 40
              percent of women who experience violence seek help of any kind. Among those who do, most seek out family
              and friends, and few use formal institutions and mechanisms, such as police and health services. Less than
              10 percent of women went to the police after suffering violence.</p>

            <p class="card-excerpt">According to 2017 data from UN Women, only 17 countries have female heads of state
              and/or government. The overall average of women in legislative bodies is only 23.4 percent. Find out who
              the female candidates are, especially women from underrepresented communities.
              In addition to politics, consider ways to support the promotion of women and LGBTQI in the arts, sciences,
              sports, and other fields.</p>
